# Task-Management-System

This project is a full-stack application for task management system using Node.js with Express for the backend and React for the frontend. This project uses MongoDB for data storage and implements RESTful API endpoints.

#### This code creates a React frontend:


Task Input: Provides input fields to add new tasks.

Handle Task Actions: Allows users to create, delete, and toggle the completion status of tasks.

Display Tasks: Displays the list of tasks and updates the UI as actions are performed.

### Steps to Run the Application

#### 1. Set up the Backend:

Install dependencies: npm install express mongoose cors

Save the backend code into appropriate files (server.js, models/Task.js, routes/tasks.js).

Start the backend server: node server.js


#### 2. Set up the Frontend:

Create a new React project if you don't have one: npx create-react-app task-app

Install Axios for HTTP requests: npm install axios

Replace the content of src/index.js, src/App.js, and src/App.css with the provided React code.

Start the React development server: npm start


#### Conclusion

This project demonstrates the development of a modern full-stack application integrating RESTful API and a responsive frontend.
